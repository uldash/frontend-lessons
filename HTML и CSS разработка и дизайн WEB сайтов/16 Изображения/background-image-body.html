    <h1>Planting Guide</h1>
    <h2>Magnolia</h2>
    <p>
        Magnolia grandiflora, commonly known as the Southern magnolia or bull bay, is a tree of the family Magnoliaceae
        native to the southeastern United States, from coastal Virginia south to central Florida, and west to eastern
        Texas and Oklahoma. Reaching 27.5 m (90 ft) in height, it is a large striking evergreen tree with large dark
        green leaves and large white fragrant flowers. Widely cultivated around the world, over a hundred cultivars have
        been bred and marketed commercially. The timber is hard and heavy, and has been used commercially to make
        furniture, pallets, and veneer.

    <h2>Ranunculus</h2>
    <p>
        Ranunculus asiaticus (Persian Buttercup) is a species of buttercup (Ranunculus) native to the eastern
        Mediterranean region in southwestern Asia, southeastern Europe (Crete, Karpathos and Rhodes), and northeastern
        Africa. It is a herbaceous perennial plant growing to 45 cm tall, with simple or branched stems. The basal
        leaves are three-lobed, with leaves higher on the stems more deeply divided; like the stems, they are downy or
        hairy. The flowers are 3-5 cm diameter, variably red to pink, yellow, or white, with one to several flowers on
        each stem.

    <h2>Tulip</h2>
    <p>
        Tulipa gesneriana L. or "Didier's tulip" is a plant belonging to the family of Liliaceae. This species has
        uncertain origins, possibly from Asia, and has become naturalised in south-west Europe. Most of the cultivated
        species, subspecies and cultivars of tulip are derived from Tulipa gesneriana. The flower and bulb can cause
        dermatitis through the allergen, tuliposide A, even though the bulbs may be consumed with little ill-effect. The
        sweet-scented bisexual flowers appear during April and May. Bulbs are extremely resistant to frost, and can
        tolerate temperatures well below freezing - a period of low temperature is necessary to induce proper growth and
        flowering, triggered by an increase in sensitivity to the phytohormone auxin. The bulbs may be dried and
        pulverised and added to cereals or flour.
