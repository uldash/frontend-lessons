            <p>
                Beneath the flashy homepages of your favorite sites lurk Hooli™ and other evil corporations out to hoard
                and sell your most personal data. What was built to be the ultimate platform for the free sharing of
                knowledge has turned into a money-hungry monster feasting on our privacy and freedom. But fear not, for
                Pied Piper has the answer! And it’s simple: An autonomous peer-to-peer network featuring distributed
                storage powered by universal compression, accelerated scheduling allocation, and end-to-end encryption.
                Put even simpler — it’s the internet, completely decentralized.

                supercomputer the world has ever seen.
